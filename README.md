# potterbot
Utilizing Tensorflow and Keras' natural language processing tools to train an NLP bot to write Harry Potter.

This content is not licensed or copyrighted by any means. I followed numerous tutorials and scrolled through dozens of stackoverflow pages to get to this point. I'm not trying to breach a new frontier or do something incredible here.

The file used to train this model was a .txt file of an unknown edition of the Philosopher's Stone found somewhere after a quick Google search. I hope I'm not infringing on any copyrights as this isn't commercial content.
### important:
THIS MODEL IS NOT A SERIOUS ATTEMPT AT CREATING COMPELX WIZARDRY NOVELS. It is rather an attempt at generating humorous material via the use of machine learning, as the final results were exactly what I had hoped for but not quite at professional standards. Feel free to actually improve the bot if you like.

Additionally, this project is not still in progress, rather this is just me uploading my work for my/anyone's future use.
Hope you enjoy!
